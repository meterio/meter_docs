# Liquidity Mining with eMTRG

If you are providing liquidity in the eMTRG/ETH trading pair on Uniswap V2, you will receive 30% APY airdrops in eMTRG directly sent to your wallet on weekly basis.

We are also partnering with [ChadSwap](https://chadswap.finance) for dual liquidity mining program. Staking the eMTRG/ETH LP tokens in on ChadSwap will earn around 100% annual returns in Stacy token.  Stacy token has about $2M liquidity in the following pool [https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xdfcc12a0aad50d84639d558551edd7a523b69ac5](https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xdfcc12a0aad50d84639d558551edd7a523b69ac5)

When harvesting Stacy, 25% is vested immediately and 75% will be vested linearly over a year.  The following tutorial explains how to claim for the remaining 75%.
