# Getting MTR for Gas

MTR is required to pay for gas and transaction fees on the Meter blockchain. &#x20;

Each transfer transaction on Meter requires about 0.0021 MTR and a swap takes around 0.016 to 0.02 MTR.  Here are the ways to get MTR if you don't want to use a centralized exchange:

## MTR airdrop on bridging funds with passport.meter.io

Bridge any assets from other blockchains to Meter through [Meter Passport](https://passport.meter.io).  Each bridge transaction will receive **0.3 MTR** in airdrop.

## Gasless swap with wallet.meter.io

Use Gasless swap in [Meter Wallet](https://wallet.meter.io/swap).  It runs a transaction relay service that helps to swap MTRG into MTR without using gas (the service pays the gas for you).
