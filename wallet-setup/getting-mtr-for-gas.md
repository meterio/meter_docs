# Getting MTR for Gas

MTR is required to pay for gas and transaction fees on the Meter blockchain.  Each transfer transaction on Meter requires about 0.0105 MTR and a swap takes around 0.02 to 0.03 MTR.  Here are the ways to get MTR if you don't want to use a centralized exchange:

1. Bridge any assets from other blockchains to Meter through [Meter Passport](https://passport.meter.io).  Each bridge transaction will receive 0.3 MTR in airdrop.
2. Use Gasless swap in [Meter Wallet](https://wallet.meter.io/swap).  It runs a transaction relay service that helps to swap MTRG into MTR without using gas (the service pays the gas for you).
