# Speeding Up/ Canceling Transactions

Meter does not use gas price to rank the transaction orders.

**Therefore, there is no point to click on the "Speed up" button for the transaction**. &#x20;

Any transactions that are not processed within 320 blocks are automatically canceled in Meter.

Also, as Metamask interacts with the Ethereum network by default, it adds wait and delay time for sending transactions. It may take up to 30 seconds for Metamask to show that a Meter transaction is confirmed, although it may already be confirmed on the Meter mainnet.&#x20;
