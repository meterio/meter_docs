# Meter Passport Architecture

One of Meter's goals is maximizing interoperability with other public blockchains.  Meter Passport is a multi-chain router that enables smart contracts to both transfer assets and communicate across blockchains.

The initial implementation of Meter Passport is an enhanced version of ChainSafe bridge based on multi-sig contract secured by five relayers including Protofire, Harshquark, Wetez, InfinityStones, and Meter team.  The upcoming v2 version will be implemented by the Meter team and support an unlimited number of relayers running consensus on the status of the source chains through the  HotStuff consensus on Meter and create threshold signature based verifications.
