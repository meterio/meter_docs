# Bridge Fee

The bridge fees are used to pay for the transaction cost for the relayers on the destination chain and the relay chain.  With the lowered bridge fee in Meter Passport v1.5, the bridge fee subsidy program is officially stopped.&#x20;

Currently all inbound bridge transactions to Meter Mainnet will receive 0.3 MTR in airdrop.
