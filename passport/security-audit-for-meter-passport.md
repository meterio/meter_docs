# Security Audit for Meter Passport V1.5

The Meter Passport v1.5 smart contracts were developed on the ChainSafe v2.x bridge contracts. Meter’s additions were mainly focusing on the relay chain signature aggregation design. The original contracts were internally audited through a separate team at ChainSafe.

The final version of the smart contracts were audited by HAECHI AUDIT.

During the audit, 8 findings of varying severity levels (three critical, two major, and three minor) were found and subsequently resolved ensuring that the codebase is rigorously tested and verified. HAECHI also recommended two tips to improve the codebase’s overall efficiency and usability.
