# MTRG Crosschain Info

## The Meter Passport

[Meter Passport](https://passport.meter.io) allows MTRG and other ERC20 and ERC721 tokens to be transferred among the supported blockchains.&#x20;

Here is important information about MTRG on different chains.  To reduce user confusion, we have decided to call all wrapped versions of MTRG on different chains as MTRG.  The Ethereum version was deployed earlier and was called eMTRG.
