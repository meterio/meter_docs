# Using Passport

## The Meter Passport

[Meter Passport](https://passport.meter.io) allows MTRG and other ERC20 and ERC721 tokens to be transferred among the supported blockchains. 

Here is important information about MTRG on different chains.  To reduce user confusion, we have decided to call all wrapped versions of MTRG on different chains as MTRG.  The Ethereum version was deployed earlier and was called eMTRG.

Ethereum:

1. eMTRG

## Operating the Same Account on Metamask and Meter Wallet

Meter Wallet supports native Meter transactions including staking, starting candidate nodes, vote on candidates.  Metamask is used in the Ethereum emulation mode to interact with dApps.  It is easy to operate the same account in both Meter Wallet and Metamask.  Meter wallet is completely [open sourced](https://github.com/meterio/meter-wallet).  Your private key will only be encrypted and stored in your local computer.

## Liquidity Mining

On Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\), we are partnering with Pancakeswap in their yield farming program. 

On Ethereum, we are partnering with [ChadSwap](https://chadswap.finance) for liquidity mining program. Uniswap liquidity providers could stake the eMTRG/ETH LP tokens in on ChadSwap to earn around 200% annual returns, of which 25% is vested immediately and 75% will be vested linearly over a year.

Whether you are participating in the liquidity mining for ChadSwap, you will receive 30% APY airdrops in eMTRG directly sent to your wallet on a weekly basis
