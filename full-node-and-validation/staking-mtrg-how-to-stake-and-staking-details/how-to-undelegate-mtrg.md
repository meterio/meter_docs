# How to Undelegate MTRG

### Purpose <a href="#5819" id="5819"></a>

“Undelegate” enables users to change the candidate on the Vote while continuing staking. This maybe done for one of the below reasons;

1\. The current candidate has been jailed leading to loss of rewards for the user

2\. The user/ acquaintance has a new node setup. The votes need to be moved to the new candidate

3\. The user wants to move Votes to a candidate with lower commission
