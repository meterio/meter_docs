# Choosing Candidates

Meter Network currently does not have uptime analytics for Node Operators. However, historically since April 2021, there has been minimum downtime across node operators.&#x20;

It is safe for users to choose any candidate to delegate their stake.

Alternatively, Users can DM “/staking (wallet address)” to @MeterValidatorBot on Telegram to get daily messages when your wallet receives the staking rewards.&#x20;

Users lose potential rewards only when the candidate they have delegated gets jailed.
