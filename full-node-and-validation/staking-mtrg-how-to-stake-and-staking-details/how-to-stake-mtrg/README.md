Staking amount < 100 gives an error.

**Note:** _Candidate is blanked out to keep the tutorial impartial_

Note: _Meter literature also refers Vote ID as “Bucket ID”. They are interchangeable terms._

**Note:** _Bonus votes increases the weight of the Vote ID in the staking rewards. Higher the bonus votes, more the staking rewards. The system rewards long term stakers with increasing bonus votes_

**Note:** _The screen shot was added post “add more” MTRG to bucket thus showing votes as 105 MTRG_
