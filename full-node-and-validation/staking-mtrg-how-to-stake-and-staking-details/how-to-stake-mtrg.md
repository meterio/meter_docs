_**Note:** The requisition address should have minimum of 100 MTRG and some MTR for transaction fees_

### Step 3

“Candidates”: Key Information

#### **Key Points to Note:** <a href="#020c" id="020c"></a>

Delegators/ Stakers will choose from the list of available candidates to delegate their stake.

The total staking rewards will depend on;

**Staking Ratio** — _More MTRG staked equals lower share per MTRG staked to the delegator/ staker. However, it also means more secure network against Sybil attacks_

**Total number of MTRG staked by the user** — _More MTRG staked by the user equal higher rewards to the delegator/ staker_

**Commission charged by the Candidate** — _More commissioned charged equal lower staking rewards to the delegator/ staker_

**Consensus Committee Size** — _Committee size lower than node count means there will be epoch where users do not receive rewards. The current committee size is 500 and node count is 285_

#### Information critical to make a decision:

**Candidate Name:** The name of the candidate node on which you can stake

**Address:** Address running the node

**Commission:** The portion of the staking rewards that will be withheld for providing the staking service

**Total Votes:** Total MTRG that has been staked/ delegated on the candidate

**nVoter:** Number of buckets (each of minimum 100 MTRG) that have been staked on the candidate

### Step 4

Stake/ Delegate to the Candidate

### Step 5

Add the amount of MTRG to be staked/ delegated

Staking amount < 100 gives an error.

**Note:** _Candidate is blanked out to keep the tutorial impartial_

### Step 6

Confirm the transaction in MetaMask

**Note:** _Typical transaction costs for staking are less than 0.05 MTR_

### Step 7

Vote ID: Key information

Note: _Meter literature also refers Vote ID as “Bucket ID”. They are interchangeable terms._

**Note:** _Bonus votes increases the weight of the Vote ID in the staking rewards. Higher the bonus votes, more the staking rewards. The system rewards long term stakers with increasing bonus votes_

**Note:** _The screen shot was added post “add more” MTRG to bucket thus showing votes as 105 MTRG_

### **You have successfully staked/ delegated your MTRG.** <a href="#652f" id="652f"></a>
