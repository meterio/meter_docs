# How to Stake Incremental MTRG

## Purpose <a href="#8a00" id="8a00"></a>

‘Vote More’ MTRG enables users to add more MTRG to the existing Vote ID. This maybe done for one of the below reasons;

1\. The user does not have additional 100 MTRG to meet the threshold to create a new Vote ID

2\. The user adds staking rewards periodically to the existing Vote ID to compound staking rewards

## Prerequisites <a href="#1ef9" id="1ef9"></a>

> 1\. Existing Vote of minimum 100 MTRG
>
> 2\. Additional MTRG to add to the Vote ID
