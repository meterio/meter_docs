# Developing with Remix, Ethers.js and Web3.js

Ethereum developers are able to use Remix to compile and debug code for Meter. The current EVM version for Meter is **Istanbul**. MTR is used instead of ETH in Ethereum.

### Remix:

Use "Injected Web3" in Remix and [configure Metamask](../wallet-setup/interacting-with-meter-mainnet-using-metamask.md) properly to deploy on Meter.

Meter also supports ethers.js and web3.js through the RPC endpoints.

## Using Ethers.js

In order to get started with the ethers.js library we first need to install it using the following command:

```
npm install ethers
```

Once this has been completed the simplest way to start using the library and its' methods is as follows:

```
const ethers = require('ethers');

// Variables definition
const privKey = '0xPRIVKEY';

// Define Provider
let provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('RPC_URL');

// Create Wallet
let wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privKey, provider);
```

Please remember to replace the PRIVKEY and RPC\_URL with the correct values.

### Using Web3.js

You can get started with the web3.js library by installing it with the following command:

```
npm install web3
```

Once this has been completed the simplest way to start using the library and its' methods is as follows:

```
const Web3 = require('web3');

//Create web3 instance
const web3 = new Web3('RPC_URL');
```

Please remember to set the `RPC_URL` to the correct RPC endpoint.
