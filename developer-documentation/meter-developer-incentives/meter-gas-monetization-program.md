Governance Proposal: [Link](https://snapshot.org/#/meter-mainnet.eth/proposal/0xf4961989316151e2f11051681998d60917f9650b56f49c407dbf0773b49c2496)

* [x] This program is a non-approval based incentive program.
* [x] This program can be leveraged in conjunction with 'Meter Developer Grant Program'
* [x] This program cannot be used in conjunction with 'Meter TVL Incentive Program'

## Core Objective

As an extension to the TVL Incentive Program, the Gas Monetization Program aims to support 2 other key network adoption metrics for Meter – Transaction Volume and User base!

## Key Performance Criteria to choose a recipient

The Gas Monetization Program is open to all applications which have more than minimum gas rebate specified for the program of 100 MTR.

## Program Incentives

The gas monetization incentive program will reimburse a PORTION of all gas fees incurred on the Meter Network by the dApp smart contracts.

Builders can use the rewards to internalize profits or use as incentives back to users.&#x20;

### Important Considerations

1. Fee reimbursements will be done monthly based on on-chain contract data
2. The DAU and transaction count will be averaged over the previous month to distribute the rewards
   * e.g. Monthly Unique Accounts interacting with the dApp = 15,000. Thus Daily Average = 500
3. The metrics will be summed over all the contracts deployed by the dApp
4. All payments will be done in MTRG based on exchange rate (MTR to MTRG) on the date of distribution

## Program Terms and Eligibility

1. The dApp should be deployed on Meter Network for >1 month.
   * e.g. If the dApp is deployed on May 11, it will be eligible for the program on June 30 distribution
2. The dev team of the dApp should fill out the google form to specify all contracts related to the dApp

3. dApps can apply for one of the 2 programs but not both:
   * METER UP TVL Incentive Program or
   * Meter Gas Monetization Program
4. dApps enjoying benefit of grant for gasless transactions (in future) will not be eligible for the Gas Monetization program

This program is still in nascency across the blockchain ecosystem, the Meter Foundation reserves the right to halt any payment stream indefinitely for any reason, including if fraudulent user activity is suspected or if the Foundation believes it is in the best interests of the Meter ecosystem.

The program will also be reviewed periodically for efficacy.

## Overall Duration for the Program

The Gas Monetization incentives will be reviewed periodically over the 1 year post launch of the program for efficacy. Any change will go through governance process.

## Key Categories

The program incentivizes transaction Volume and user base on the network. Though the program is more relevant to GameFI dapps, all categories can leverage the program.

1. DeFI Protocols (Derivatives, Lending, Stablecoin Solutions, Insurance, Yield Optimizers, Reserve Currency)
2. Gaming (P2E, Move to Earn, Metaverse, GameFI etc.)&#x20;
3. DEX (AMMs with farms)

## MTRG Incentive Distribution

1. MTRG Rewards are distributed at the end of every month to each protocol’s \`Deployer Address’ submitted in the Registration Form.
2. Incentives will be distributed in the beginning of the month based on on-chain transaction data&#x20;

**Note:** The example assumes a certain average gas cost. Actual gas costs will determine the extent of gas monetization.
